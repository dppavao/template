## Configuration Management

I see that configuration management is a great tool to have when working in groups or alone on big projects. The ability to keep track of where changes are made, when changes are made, and who made changes can prevent problems and frustration from occuring in the near future.

Over my years as a student so far, I've worked in a few groups in programming projects. Issues such as modifying code incorrectly and saving or interfering with other members ideas seem to commonly occur. I feel that with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), These problems could have possibly been prevented. It's very convenient to have be able to push and pull changes from and to others. If it turns out that the changes were not a good idea to add, I could always revert to the previous version with no problem.

## GitHub and Git


Knowing that Git is a popular technology for configuration management and that GitHub is a popular hosting service makes me wonderif Git became popular from GitHub or GitHub became popular from Git. I believe Github was created because of Git. This meaning that GitHub only became popular because of the existance of Git. I also believe that the use of Git is more powerful than that of GitHub. GitHub seems easier to use but Git is more efficient to use.
