## JavaScript

My Software Engineering class, ICS 314, has introduced to a new programming language called JavaScript. For the past week, I was assigned to a bunch of exercises on JavaScript coding. Prior to this assignment, I had experience C, C++, and Python. It was relaxing to sit down and learn a little bit of JavaScript and how it was similar and different from the languages I already knew. For example, declaring variables in C is very different from declaring variables in JavaScript. Overall, JavaScript is very relatable to the other languages I know.

## Workout Of the Day

I find this workouts of the day to be very useful. Given only 4 minutes or 5 minutes of a task has challenged me. At first, it was stressful because my typing is not the fastest and I'm used to given much longer time to think about the problem. Although at the same time, I find these WODs enjoyable becasue I love programming. From these WODs I have given myself a goal to type at least twice as fast as I can now.

## Style of Learning

I like the style of learning where I have to push myself to do work. I think it's great to learn from doing exercises while being pressured to finish quickly. In my opinion, this style should be effectively taking less time to learn more.
