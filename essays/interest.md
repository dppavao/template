Computers caught my interests from when I was young and only wanted to play games and have fun. When I got bored of these games, I started to grow an interest in creating computer programs and improving it which later led to my interest in software engineering. 

I hope to further my knowledge on languages I know(C, C++, Python, Arduino) and gain knowledge on other programming languages. In the future I hope to use all of what I learn to better software for everyone to interact with.

I have plenty of experience working in small groups for projects that I've done in my classes. I hope to work for large companies such as Apple or Microsoft in hopes of creating an impact to society.
