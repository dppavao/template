## Out Of This World Technology

Recommend meteor to you? The answer to that question would be a definite *NO*. At least that's what I inititally thought about this software. It all started making my first hello world assignment with meteor. Mindlessly copy and pasting multiple lines of code that I've never seen before. Why are there double curly brackets? What are templates? Oh cool, I've made an interesting page with a counter and a bunch of links and I do not know how any of it works. Why am I spending my time to learn this? The questions didn't stop after the first assignment. The next assignment was more copying, but this time from a video. The assignment after that was yet another tutorial. Being told to enter long commands in the console and in the server caused much confusion. What am I doing?

## Seeing Meteor Showers

Luckily after many dreadful moments with meteor, I finally began to see the beauty it had to offer. Developing a webpage became quick because of the use of the application template. Oddly enough, the HTML and JavaScript can be taken from the template and modified to fit what we want. The only thing we really need to do is put all that information in the right spots. Of course, the stress learning about these things that meteor has to offer us was massive. However, I appreciate meteor and plan to continue learning and using it for future web pages.
