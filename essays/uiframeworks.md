## Thoughts on Semantic UI 

Initially [Semantic UI] (http://semantic-ui.com/) was difficult to learn. However, after being exposed to copying various webpages with Semantic UI, I was glad that I took the time to learn about it. Compared to raw HTML and CSS, Semantic UI provided features that were much easier to understand. Building headers and footers using menus and containers could easily be done by declaring classes where you wanted it. Using Semantic UI saved a whole bunch of lines of coding and a whole bunch of time.

## Benefits of UI Frameworks

As said before, the use of Semantic UI and UI Frameworks saves a whole lot of time in development of a webpage. For example, creating a header with spaced out menu options takes time to think about and code into the HTML and CSS files. With UI Frameworks, it's already done for you and can be created by a simple call to the class. Overall, UI Frameworks save time and time is very limited when aiming to finish a big project.
