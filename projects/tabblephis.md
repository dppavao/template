This was the first project assigned to me in my college career. This game is similar to the 2-player game battleship. However, Tabblephis is a single player game. A player must travel through the map, guess the location of a ship and fire a torpedo. There a total of six ships. To win, these ships must be sunken before using all the 40 torpedoes provided. 

For this project, I worked in a group of three people. My part of the assignment was to create the movement controls for the player as well as the player movement around the map. We tried to make sure that the work was split equally between the three of us.

This was a great project for applying everything I had learned in class that semester. This project showed me how to work with others, specifically interpreting their code and incorporating it with mine. Overall, I gained a great amount of experience in progamming in C.
